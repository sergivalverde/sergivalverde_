##  Meeting Lili

- [[Design history file ]]:  who is going to manage it?  We need traction in this direction. 
- The weekly Monday discussion was used by [Liliana Valencia](../_people/Liliana%20Valencia.md) to track what people was doing and ask for their time if she needed them during the week. 
- This shows a lack of structure  in how we organize the talks we are doing. 
- There is no clear roadmap to follow in the company.  It's difficult to set goals when you don't have a clear roadmap.  
- How we synchronize between team members?

# Daily recap

Interesting day opened to listening.  Discovered a new technique from Lluís Sánchez to approach people by looking for another persona that knows the one you want to connect. This person introduces you to the target. 

Also,,a very interesting afternoon with [Liliana Valencia](../_people/Liliana%20Valencia.md)  at the co-writing space where we discussed how things are going and what we can do to improve the culture of the startup.  The main point of Liliana is that we need to impose more structure and follow things better to avoid frustration in the loony term.  How to use cycles and these things.
