# Top of mind

This is a test of the document. 

Try to incorporate different tools for this. 
In some circumstances, this can be tricky to do, but I think it can be interesting to note that this can work. 

This is a test to see if [Github](../pages/Github.md) works. 

[Build tools around workflows, not workflows around tools](../pages/Build%20tools%20around%20workflows,%20not%20workflows%20around%20tools.md) is the way to go these days. 

Using [Basecamp](../pages/Basecamp.md) as an example of what can be done.
