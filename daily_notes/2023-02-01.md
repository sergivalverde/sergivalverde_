# Notes

## Lesion model
- errors in synthesis not filtered by difference between timepoints. 
- 0.05 level must be rethinked. 
	- in 1000162940 fails because it's just 3 voxels.  
- SAJ01 -> FP because not WM (inside) check if this can be done

### things to move
- 0.5 and 10 voxels.  increase the % of WM and boundaries.
- in 0.3 and 0.4 increase the % of GM and boundaries


## Improvements in the production pipeline
Every time we want to change or tune the system in a hospital we need to run again all the case (registration, processing, inference) while we may want only to tune the parameters.  

We need a way to tune up the model without reprocessing the cases.  If the lesion probability mask is there, we can just run the rest of the filtering code and move on.

## NEOTEC
- NUBICA and others in Linkedin
- Having a clear feedback and understand how to improve the code.
