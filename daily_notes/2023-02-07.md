# Notes

## Prototype
- Non-local means and a minimum 0.2 threshold stabilizes the method, but we lose some lesions. Can we improve this? 

## QMS
- validation of the software. How to do it? 
- We need more resources. [Roger Bramon](../_people/Roger%20Bramon.md) can't do everything by his own. 
- [Albert Clèrigues](../_people/Albert%20Clèrigues.md) can be the key here if we can manage to pivot him to software development during the following months. 

## International study
Participating centers: 
- Rome 80 cases
- Paris  50 cases
- Graz 80 cases
- Barcelona 103 cases
- Bruges -> ===x== 
- Amsterdam ->  ===x=== 
- TOTAL => 350 if Bruges is uploading cases. 

## QMS documents
Review again this pull request: it's complex to understand and digest:
