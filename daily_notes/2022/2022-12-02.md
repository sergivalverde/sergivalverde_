# Notes

# Girona next 
Feelings after the meeting.  I feel envious about Diana from SLP.  Also, because they are personalizing the project in themselves. Do I want this? Definitely not. It's limiting my focus to accomplish my goals. 

With Girona next, the important thing is to benefit from what they can offer us: health hub, pitches, investors, etc... be humble with this and use whatever they can offer the company. 

Don't lose focus.
