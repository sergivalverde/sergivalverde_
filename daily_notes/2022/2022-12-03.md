How to convert my work in something similar to [[../pages/Shin Okuda]] and his endeavors.  Software in the hospital with style.

## How to structure projects on Github

```mermaid 
flowchart TD
MIL[[Milestones]]
CYCLES(6-week cycles)
ISSUES(Issues as epics)
ISSUES_TASKS(Issues as tasks)
CHECKLISTS(Checklists)

MIL -- "Milestones are set up for big goals like implement a new viewer"--> CYCLES
CYCLES -- "6-week cycles are used for immediate project goals and product iterations"--> ISSUES
ISSUES --"Issues can be used as tasks inside 'epics'"--> ISSUES_TASKS
ISSUES --"Checklists inside issues can be used to track relevant tasks to the issue or epic"--> CHECKLISTS

```
