## Pitch deck and the campaign image
* invested a lot of time in this task today. 
* The final result makes sense and it's interesting.  ü§û

## Personal 
* daily recap
* rituals to start working: something that changes the way I work and live (in the same place)
* Meditation and exercise should be the first thing to do. I'm going crazy with the same screen every day working from the kitchen.

# Daily recap

The pitch deck took most of my energy and time yesterday.  The good thing is that I worked stand up all day.  But I did not finish most of the tasks that I have opened.
