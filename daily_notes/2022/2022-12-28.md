# Notes

## Jesus Martos
- Meeting with Jesus after two years. Interesting person with whom you have many interesting things to share. Why don't you talk more with him? 
### Waking up episodes with Jack Cornfield
- What Dalai Lama says: “I try to treat everything as it would be an old friend.”
- Some reflections on the teachings: 
	- Why do you need something more than your brain to be happy. Identify what happens when emotions arise. 
	- Useless words. 
	- Fascinating idea: Try to do as good as possible to the people around you. 
	- Example of Ryokan. 
	- ==Attention is everything. ==
### Personal
