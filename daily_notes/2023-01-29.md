# Notes

## Thinking about how to synthesize more cases
How to add more interesting cases to the synthetic pipeline? We have many cases that are not being processed and could be added. 

### What to do:
1. Identify stable Philips patients on servers and process them to be usable.
2. Understand the code logic that you were using and document the changes in GitHub. 
3. Process cases and generate lesions with the new code. 
4. Train the model with Philips cases.
5. Understand the effect on other Philips images and compare with the basal model. 

## What I need to understand
- how generalizable the pipeline is. 
- how to generate more realistic and more suitable lesions. 

## tests with the Ipad

I'm doing these tests with the Ipad, so working in Obsidian with it.
