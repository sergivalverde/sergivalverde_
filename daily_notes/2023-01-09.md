<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Things that did not go well</mark>
* Decision making
* Strategic thinking and planning
	* Clinical validation
	* Funding...
	* Costs (QMS costs with AMBIT)
* Technical development and research. 

Most of the things that did not work are related with the strategy and the kind of things we invested our time.  As a ceo, I was not investing time  to track the goals of the company.  Why? So because i was doing other things instead.  Is this bad per se? 



# ðŸ’¡ IDEAS
* Being very aggressive with the time of the team. 
* Be very specific with the goals and decisions of the team. 
* <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Learn how to manage and iterate over the most important things to do</mark>

- Why is he convinced that our solution can have an impact.  
-  How NEOTEC can be desastrous for the collaboration.
