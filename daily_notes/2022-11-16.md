# Notes

## How to handle information? 
After opening the mail of the Bruges I see that the calendar itself is not enough to handle the information required in the email. It imposes on me different tasks to do. 
### Questions? 
* How to handle these types of tasks? 
	* One way of doing it is by having a task manager where I can add tasks. 
	* Each task can have a priority and so on...
* How to handle followups? 
	* Followups are coming usually from: 
		* Sent emails that require a response.
		* Other performed communications that require a response. In my case, what is this? 
			* Somebody has to do something and I want to be sure to check for it. 
			* Reminders for everything that has to be rechecked is very effective but you need the correct tool for that.
