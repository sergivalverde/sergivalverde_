This document describes the workflow used for my personal productivity. The system is somehow inspired by [Sam Corcos](https://review.firstround.com/an-exact-breakdown-of-how-one-ceo-spent-his-first-two-years-of-company-building#ditch-your-to-do-list#unblocking-others-is-your-top-priority#ditch-your-to-do-list) and the [SYSTEMIST](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/systemist) system developed by Amir SalihefendiÄ‡ (Todoist).

## ï»¿ðŸ¤–ï»¿ Moving gears

The following subsections describe the fundamental steps to use this productivity system.

### ï»¿ðŸ“±ï»¿ Take it everywhere

The developed system must be useful from everywhere, mostly the phone and the computer. This is especially relevant for **[the capturing step](https://app.clickup.com/2665165/docs/2hapd-9945/2hapd-26305?block=block-aa693faf-3240-479e-89ed-02071b8dcb29)**.

### Capture everything

The main goal of this productivity system is to capture **everything that must need my attention** in the near future, coming from many sources such as mail, webpages, meetings, comments with team members, etcâ€¦ This means that it will require a strong commitment to filtering and aggressive pruning of the tasks that are not being carried out.

**When?** This process is automatic, and it's performed every time that a new potential have to be captured from the email, etcâ€¦

### Iterative steps

#### 1. Break all the daily tasks into small and actionable tasks

Break big tasks into a number of smaller sub-tasks that can be completed in one hour or less. This allows you to estimate the total time involved more accurately. Itâ€™s also critical to make tasks specific and actionable. Donâ€™t keep items that you canâ€™t complete.

**When?** This process is performed during the morning, once the task is selected to work during the day. This means that for each of the tasks, I must think how to split it in smaller and actionable parts.

#### 2. Assign the resulting tasks a time slot during the day

For each of the tasks to complete, assign a due date for the current day.

By making the tasks into actionable items, we can translate them to dedicated energy and attention during the day.

#### 3. Daily review

During the last part of the day, block time to review the day and what went well and what not. It is crucial to celebrate progress of the day and to evaluate how productive I was according to my predictions.

**When?** At the end of the day, summarize everything that has been done.

#### 4. Filter out new tasks

From all the captured events, filter the events that must be completed as tasks and categorize them according to the.

#### 5. Re-prioritize tasks for the next day

This process requires to re-prioritizing the tasks according to their urgency and relevance using the Clickup label system. This process must be done after filtering and adding the new captured tasks.

**When?** This process is performed once a day, preferably in the afternoon after the [Daily Review](https://app.clickup.com/2665165/docs/2hapd-9945/2hapd-26305?block=block-2800b8f6-3d46-4ce5-840d-9aef45209655). By doing it at the end of the day, we reduce the overhead to think what to do during the next morning, while also the anxiety of thinking what to do.

## ðŸ”¥ Tracking energy and resources

The most complex part of any productivity system is to transform the infinite number of things to do into concrete chunks of time and attention. For energy tracking (time), it is crucial to assign tasks to calendar's chunks of time or to other way that correlates with my energy levels.

By filling tasks in time chunks in advance, we are betting on the most important parts to accomplish. The productivity hack is to be mindful how you use your time during a period of time. Is this the best time to use my time?

There are different ways to approach this, based on calendars (Sam Corcos) or assigning due dates in tasks (SYSTEMIST). The process I chose here is more based on the SYSTEMIST way of working, although Clickup permits also to incorporate a calendar view.

## Weekly feedback

Every Friday afternoon, we keep track of the current week and analyze how productive it was, what was working well and what not. During these intervals, we can measure the percentage of tasks that I have completed for each of the categories.

The results from this weekly feedback are used to redefine the tasks to perform during the following week.
