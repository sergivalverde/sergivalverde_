On March 2022, EU and US released ([EU version](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_2087), [US version](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/25/united-states-and-european-commission-joint-statement-on-trans-atlantic-data-privacy-framework/)) a joint statement on Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework. This is the latest proposal to address the [concerns raised by the Court of Justice](https://www.zdnet.com/article/european-court-strikes-down-eu-us-privacy-shield-citizen-data-transfer-agreement/) of the European Union in the _Schrems II_ decision of July 2020 on the Data Shield proposal.

On 13 December 2022, [the European Commission issued a draft adequacy decision](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_7631) concluding that the EU-US Data Privacy Framework provides an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from EU to US companies. [Approved by the US following President Joe Biden’s executive order in October 2022](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/07/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-executive-order-to-implement-the-european-union-u-s-data-privacy-framework/), the framework is designed to enable the sharing of data between the EU and the US without the need for additional safeguards or measures. 

This draft needs to be reviewed by EDPB and issue a nonbinding decision. It's estimated that the European Commission will make its final decision within six months (i.e., by late spring or early summer 2023).

This is good news for all organisations that transfer personal data from the EU to the US – in particular, the 5,300+ multinational companies that previously relied on the Privacy Shield regime for EU-US data transfers before it was invalidated by _Schrems II_ in July 2020. The new framework directly addresses the issues raised in _Schrems II_ through restrictions on US national security data collection methods, and a redress mechanism for EU citizens in the event of an alleged privacy violation, including a newly created Data Protection Review Court.

## Microsoft EU Data Boundary

In parallel, Microsoft is working on a solution called EU Data Boundary that will keep all EU business data stored in Europe. 

On January 1st, 2023, [Microsoft begins the first phase of the EU Data Boundary rollout](https://blogs.microsoft.com/eupolicy/2022/12/15/eu-data-boundary-cloud-rollout/). With this release, Microsoft will store and process customer data for Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, Power Platform and the majority of Azure services in the EU and EFTA. When properly configured, customer data that you provide (your customer data) will be processed and stored in the region, greatly reducing your data flows out of the EU and EFTA.

In addition, with the rollout of the EU Data Boundary, Microsoft will publish new data flow documentation on the new [EU Data Boundary Trust Center webpage](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center/privacy/european-data-boundary-eudb) to provide transparent data insights for customers whose services will be included in the boundary.

The [EU Data Boundary documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/privacy/eudb/eu-data-boundary-learn) offer documentation on configuring Azure services for the EU Data Boundary, specially [for non-regional services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/privacy/eudb/eu-data-boundary-configure-azure-nonregional-services).
