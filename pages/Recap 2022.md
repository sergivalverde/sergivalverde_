# Discussion 

Most of the things that did not work are related with the strategy and the kind of things we invested our time.  As a  CEO was not investing time  to track the goals of the company.  Why? So because i was doing other things instead.  Is this bad per se? 



# ðŸ’¡ IDEAS
* Being very aggressive with the time of the team. 
* Be very specific with the goals and decisions of the team. 
* <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Learn how to manage and iterate over the most important things to do</mark>   
* we need a consistent agenda to track progress in all the important directiions of the company.
