# Culture Handbook

Culture is what binds us together as a team.

It’s the set of assumptions we can make about one another without having interacted before. It's the way in which we get our work done, use our tools, and communicate and collaborate. It's the filter for whom we work with and the agreed upon rules for working together.

We all play an active and daily role in shaping and forming this culture.

Were we to abandon our intentional culture – or not steward it as carefully – it would take natural turns and we could end up with confusion, misalignment, infighting, disrespect, and a loss of cohesion. Intentionally setting, communicating, and focusing on our culture is the antidote to such outcomes.

Our cultural values have positively supported our mission to date and paid positive dividends, and we intend to continue building on this investment.

This handbook is a living document, meant to be added to, edited, and refined as our company and team grows. In it you'll find our thoughts on how we treat one another, how we are building our company, and the details of how we work.

# How We Treat Each Other

## We are a team, not a family

The easiest place to start is by quoting [Tobi from Shopify](https://www.linkedin.com/news/story/shopify-ceo-were-a-team-not-family-5060180/):

> [*Shopify](https://www.linkedin.com/company/shopify/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_feed_storyline%3BKPkfeu0gT8mkHz7cAc46mw%3D%3D), like any other for-profit company, is not a family. The very idea is preposterous. You are born into a family. You never choose it, and they can't un-family you....The dangers of "family thinking" are that it becomes incredibly hard to let poor performers go. Shopify is a team, not a family.*

Using family-oriented language sets weird expectations for those that you work with. We're here to solve the metabolic health crisis above all else, and as a remote/async company we cannot be the primary social outlet for peoples' lives.

That said, Levels is a very friendly, engaging, and human group. We care about one another's well-being and have plenty of social outlets to build trust and relationships. And since we don't have any office overhead, we encourage travel for the sake of getting to know each other without any cold, hard deliverables on the table. You won't be lonely on this team.

## We treat one another like adults

This means that we **trust** one another to use discretion and make decisions with good judgement in order to move projects and the business forward.

When and if someone makes a mistake, we respond by learning from the situation and supporting them through it so that they are supported – not reprimanded. We avoid implementing policies and red-tape as a reaction to one thing going wrong one time.

If we tell our team how to live their lives (e.g. You're required to take vacation on these days; we'll give you money to exercise; we'll coordinate your social life for you) without a specific company objective (e.g. lifestyle incentive program makes sense if we get a content deliverable and a learning from it; taking a contiguous week off per quarter enforces good patterns of documentation and redundancy), it feels paternalistic and hypocritical. We'll try to avoid this.

[_More: Trust & Autonomy at Levels_](https://www.notion.so/Trust-Autonomy-at-Levels-1d12921f0ae44a879bc914943061643a)

## We're tolerant, accepting, and kind

**We expect everyone on our team to be tolerant of one another.** Tolerance is the willingness and the ability to recognize that even though others may have opinions that you may disagree with, you can still have productive working and personal relationships with them, and assume good intent.

We respect everyone’s right to personal expression, whether it’s a majority or minority opinion. As a company, we won’t weigh in on causes or issues that are unrelated to our business or mission, and we’ll maintain focus on our collective mission by keeping political discussions out of the workplace.

## We have "short toes"

This idiom is [taken from GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#short-toes), so we'll just quote them directly:

> People joining the company frequently say, "I don't want to step on anyone's toes." At GitLab, we should be more accepting of people taking initiative in trying to improve things. As companies grow, their speed of decision-making goes down since there are more people involved. We should counteract that by having short toes and feeling comfortable letting others contribute to our domain.

Anyone can contribute to any part of the company at any time. There are no fiefdoms at Levels and nobody's responsibilities are sacred.

In fact, if you tell someone on the team that you can take something off their plate, they'll probably be thrilled!

-   For more on this, listen to @Braden McCarthy's experience on the podcast.

## We employ ["Yes, and..." Thinking]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and)...)

We want to have a "Yes, and" culture, not a culture of passive criticism. This is [a concept borrowed from improv comedy]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and)...). To be clear, we're not requiring the speech pattern of saying "yes, and..." when you disagree with someone — only to remember to be positive and to avoid passive criticism.

When someone shares an idea, they're putting themselves out there and opening themselves up to criticism, which is a very real risk. It feels bad when that idea gets shot down, and that person is less likely to contribute in the future.

It's easy to be critical of someone else's ideas, and unfortunately, we tend to [perceive those who criticize as being of higher intelligence](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28369901/), which makes criticism more likely to occur.

There's nothing worse than getting an ambiguous "no" to a project with no obvious next step for how to unblock it, or passive criticism that has the result of making you look dumb in front of your colleagues. **There should always be a clear next step, and everyone is responsible for helping us get there.**

To be clear, we're not saying that you should never disagree with someone — in fact, we disagree all the time! But there is a difference between disagreement and passive criticism.

## We commit to eliminating gossip

Gossip is a statement made about someone else with negative intent. It’s usually something that **the person would be unwilling to share in exactly the same way if that person were in the room** (or on the call, or on the thread.**)**

Though it may feel cathartic to participate in gossip by validating ones own thinking and connecting with the folks we’re gossiping with, it’s an example of poor leadership and leads to unhealthy dynamics that derail motivation, teamwork, and creativity.

To foster a productive environment, **we commit to talking directly to people with whom we have thoughts or concerns**, and we encourage others who may gossip with us to do the same.

If you gossip and are made aware of it, **clean it up by revealing your participation in the gossip to everyone involved.** If you’re a receiver of gossip, you can reinforce the intended cultural behaviors by asking the sender _**"What did {x person} say when you told them this directly?".**_

# How We Run Our Company

---

## Incentives matter

It's critical to set up the company's business model with the right incentives. Any entity that has misaligned incentives will fail in the long-run — or at the very least, operate in a way that is antagonistic towards its customers.

We are focused on building a business model that **aligns our incentives with the health and happiness of our members**.

## Member-focused, not Competitor-focused

**We focus on our members first.** This means we don't feel the need to 👀 when a competitor releases an updated product, is featured on a podcast we like, or makes a big fundraising announcement. Focusing on our members will help us do the right thing for the long-term.

We should be aware of our environment and competitive surroundings, but avoid focusing on each play that each competitor is making on their respective fields. That's the best way to lose sight of what's going on in our own game.

<aside> 👉 For example, it's ok to share a link about a competitor's product launch if there are insights or significant changes in the industry worth noting. We should avoid going over the top here, though – it's easy fall into the trap of placing too much focus on what others are doing.

# How We Work

---

## **We're async — and we really mean it**

We’re remote-first. Our communication is default asynchronous, and we try to have as few meetings as possible. Synchronous communication can be distracting when not used correctly; this doesn't mean that we shouldn't meet when meetings are required, but we should be cognizant of not distracting others with synchronous messages when urgent responses aren't required.

The Levels team works remotely and has different schedules – we do not have a centralized office, and believe that people can get their work done from anywhere that they choose.

    Darren Murph, Head of Remote at GitLab, joined our Friday Forum on December 17, 2021 – here’s his outlook on Remote and what Levels is building from a cultural standpoint.
    

## **We're a memo culture, not a meeting culture**

We document relentlessly. As a distributed and remote team, we've found that the best way to collaborate on ideas is to write out one's ideas in long-form, then send the documents to relevant team members to add their thoughts. In short, we're a memo culture, [not a meeting culture](http://levels.link/meetings).

<aside> 👉 If someone asks for information that is already documented somewhere, **it's not disrespectful to respond with a link to the document or discussion itself**. It's not reasonable to expect that everyone has read all the documentation given how much stuff there is to read through, so it's 100% ok to link someone to existing resources.

This provides them full context, empower them with information, and reinforce our async culture. For example, "For sure! You can find that documented here (link)"

</aside>

We document everything thoroughly, every single time, even when it seems repetitive. And then we update the docs the next time to make sure they're up to date.

Clear and thorough documentation powers our asynchronous and remote work culture. It creates redundancy and resilience. It allows others to do their job with full context, and removes the need to ask those "quick questions" which interrupt workflows.

## We value time & efficiency

**If you find yourself repeating a task often,** you should pause and find a way to make the process more efficient, or remove it from your workflow all together. ****It's easy to keep doing small easy tasks, but they add up over time and distract from the larger efforts you could be focusing on instead. Consider automating, streamlining, or outsourcing the task to protect your time.

**If you find yourself working on a task that someone other than you could probably do just as well,** consider outsourcing it. You were hired for a very specific skillset and ability to execute, so administrative or repetitive tasks should be outsourced and managed. This _doesn't_ mean that you can abstract far enough away to not know how the work is actually done, though.

**Our time is currently worth more than money.** If spending a few thousand dollars for a vendor to provide something will allow us to cut _n_ months off of a project, we should absolutely make that trade. If we can trade money for time, we almost always will. This is an edge we have as a venture-backed startup.

## We are calm, not busy

Avoid "the curse of busyness". **Being busy is not a badge of honor, but instead an indicator of a failure to plan and manage time effectively.** The feeling of busyness is contagious and it negatively affects others on the team, so we place an emphasis on creating a calm work environment – free of fire drills, pings, recurring meetings, and frenetic last minute requests.

**You should feel a sense of accomplishment after most workdays**, and feel content closing your computer and stepping a way with a sense of calm. We'd rather you spend 5-6 hours in a focused flow state, making breakthroughs and massive progress towards your priorities as opposed to spending 8-9 hours doing a million things but not really getting anything meaningful done.

<aside> ⭐ **We value deep work and we mean it**. It's not unusual for an engineer at Levels to average 2 meetings per week, or for someone in operations to have less than 3 hours of scheduled meetings per week.

</aside>

There will be times when you'll have to put in hours and work extra hard to address a priority or handle a situation. It'll feel great to see how far you can push yourself, to feel the adrenaline of redlining and learn your limits. This mode isn't sustainable beyond a few days though, and should be an exception to your usual working cadence.

## We ship

If we're not experimenting, we're not moving forward. If we're not learning, we're regressing. If we're not being scrappy and finding the path of least resistance, then we're taking too long to ship. If we're not shipping, then we're not moving with velocity.

Being scrappy is key – perfection is the antithesis of progress. Ship fast and often 🚢.

## We value openness

We believe in the power of networks and sharing. We share liberally and keep confidential information to a minimum, both internally and externally.

## We experiment and take risks

We encourage active experimentation and risk taking, even when there's a possibility of a negative outcome. In fact, the learnings of a positive result are equally as valid as the learnings from a negative one.

We'll shy away from using language like "celebrating failures", since the term failure can imply that someone did a bad or avoidable thing. **So long as we're approaching experimentation and risk-taking with good, sound _strategy_, a good or a bad outcome is a welcome result that helps us make progress towards our goals.**

# How you should work

> [!👉] 
>   This section contains pointers of functional skills that we've observed from one another. Feel free to add your own to the bottom for discussion & consideration.

## Be a Responsible Executer

Everyone is expected to move things forward and own their areas. We don't need to be asked what to do, or wait for permission. We bring ideas forward to the team, and execute them through to completion.

## Close the loop

We close the loop rigorously.

When we finish a project, we close the loop. When someone makes an intro to us, we close the loop with them a few weeks later and let them know the outcome. When a Member gives us feedback, we close the loop to let them know we implemented it – even if it's 6 months down the road. We do everything we can to close the loop and never drop the ball on communication.

Closing the loop isn't just necessary – it's in our company DNA.

## Take the big swings

When a big opportunity comes, we take it.

We aren't interested in incremental progress, we've set out to change a space. We're creating a new category and solving a global problem.

## Don't be a blocker

Work isn't about putting up road blocks, it's about solving challenges together. Always maintain focus on shared goals, and avoid giving passive criticism that grinds us to a halt.

**Passive criticism** is what happens when someone voices their concern in a conversation about ideas or proposals. Their intent may be genuine, but doing this effectively shuts down the conversation and exchange of ideas, stops the group from getting to a better solution, and doesn't feel great.

> *The passive criticism and repeated surfacing of (possible) problems and risks does not feel like a constructive addition to conversation.
> 
> Passive criticism becomes toxic, confusing, disempowering.
> 
> Casey Means*

**Blocking efforts** through lack of commitment, input or decision making slows down our team.

If you're blocked on a project, address it directly and loop in team members accordingly. Let people know that you're being blocked, so that challenges can be resolved quickly.

This applies for the small things, too. If someone needs something from you in order to move forward and and it takes less than a few minutes for you to do, just do it.

## Disengage from semantic loops

Semantic and definitional differences are important and meaningful in that they highlight different areas we may want to consider. The problem is when we get stuck there and exchange too many words and too much time on something that doesn't _really_ matter, or can be changed later.

We should be mindful of this trap and have an escape hatch handy, along time lines of, "Here is the term, and here is the definition of the term — let's all agree that going forward, when we say X, it means Y. Any other use of that term going forward is no longer valid."

## Disagree and commit

_More: [Principles of Decision Making - October 2021](https://www.notion.so/Principles-of-Decision-Making-October-2021-e6c8a50683da4ced867eaa25d72a9301)_

*From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit): Disagree and commit is a management principle which states that **individuals are allowed to disagree while a decision is being made, but that once a decision has been made, everybody must commit to it.**

The principle can also be understood as a statement about when it is useful to have conflict and disagreement, with the principle saying **disagreement is useful in early states of decision-making while harmful after a decision has been made**. Disagree and commit is a method of avoiding the consensus trap, in which the lack of consensus leads to inaction.*

-   More & video on _**How to disagree & commit**_
    
    -   Assume best intent. This is not a random stranger, it's someone who has signed up for the same mission
    -   Drop ego. Your goal in disagreement should never be to be right. It should be about doing what's best for our members/community/company in that order.
    -   Take the shortest line of action. The first person to hear your feedback or position should always be the person responsible for the decision. Do not go above or around people until you have gone directly to them.
    -   Engage early with transparency and honesty. Make sure you share your feedback at the exploration or draft phase. Don't save your thoughts for later. Once we have committed and are executing on a project, disagreement with the plan becomes a roadblock and leads to frustration and malice.
    -   Escalation 1: synchronous call. If the normal feedback process leads to firmly held disagreement, have a synchronous call between the two parties. Try to understand the why behind each position and get to an agreed path forward.
    -   Escalation 2: peer or subject matter expert. If the disagreements are still held, pull in a peer. Ask them to review the positions as a 3rd perspective to break the tie.
    -   Escalation 3: up the chain to leadership. If after peer input, the matter is not resolved, mutual escalation is the last step. Agree on who to escalate to - this is likely the functional lead or someone in leadership, like Sam. This person will make the final decision.
    -   Commit. Once the decision is made, it's time to execute! This is a good thing, we're unblocked and have a path forward. Steelman the position if it wasn't yours. Advocate for it fully, get it done with 100% effort. We will reevaluate at the next phase to make sure it worked as expected. Don't hold grudges, don't hope for an 'I told you so' opportunity. This is the plan and we should all hope it succeeds.

## Paint the back of the fence

-   Moving fast doesn't mean forgetting small details
-   We execute small details to make progress easier in the future
-   This doesn't mean that we dwell on decisions about small details – it means we move fast to execute small details across the company
    -   An example of this is taking an extra 7mins to record a Loom that will help someone to learn or understand a process in the future – details and documentation make things better for our entire team
-   We create thoughtful touches and do the groundwork every day, as opposed to saying, _"I'm too busy to sweep the floor today..."_
-   It’s easy to let small tasks linger, but if everyone does this in the company, it forms a snowball so big that the entire organization suffers.
-   If it needs to happen, get it done.

## Give real, helpful feedback

-   Give feedback fast and often – even if it's something small. If it helps our team get better, open up the conversation.
    
-   We help each other improve every day.

    [‎LEVELS - A Whole New Level: #73 - Giving & Receiving Feedback (Ben Grynol & Michael Mizrahi) on Apple Podcasts]()
    
-   @Mike Haney’s three rules of giving feedback, November 22, 2022
    
    I recently had an experience here giving feedback on something and realizing almost immediately it did not land the way I'd hoped, mostly because I was not very thoughtful in delivering it.
    
    Reflecting on this, I realized we talk a lot about [Feedback is a Gift](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UUXeT-IRxiPOMo1PxW7pJbDX8sJH8uLIsg-f6CYc-nU/edit#slide=id.gdc35a4b8c8_0_52), which emphasizes the receiver's role, but that I hadn't thought enough about the sender's responsibility.
    
    So I've come up with Three Rules of Giving Feedback I'm trying to incorporate for myself. Take them FWIW.
    
    -   **Feedback without context is just talking.** In my case, I didn't have full background on the thing I was giving feedback on, so much of my feedback was just completely misguided. The good thing about Levels is that there usually a document somewhere with that context; the downside is it can be very hard to find. If you've looked for that context and not found it, don't give the feedback yet! Just ask the other party where you can find it. Speaking of which ...
    -   **Ask questions.** Even if you've read all the Notion docs and watched all the Looms, you don't know everything. So where ever possible, just ask questions. i.e., Instead of "I'm not sure this is a good use of our time." --> "How are you thinking about the ROI for this"? And if you find yourself writing snarky, passive aggressive or leading questions, move on to point 3 ...
    -   **Just f'ing wait a minute.** I've never regretted waiting to send an email or Loom; I've only regretted responding too quickly. And the more exasperated or annoyed or threatened I feel, the longer I need to wait. If that devil on your shoulder (Ego) is saying "But you need to respond _now_ before this gets even worse!" just shoot the other person a note saying "I will definitely respond to this, I just want to take a day to get my thoughts together."
    
    Feedback gone wrong can really zap the trust battery. Would love to hear if anyone else has thoughts, tips, ideas, on giving feedback constructively.
    

## Roll with the punches

It's the nature of startups to face challenges and need to adapt quickly and often. Facing adversity with positive energy and ingenuity will help us move forward through these challenges. Remember, our job here **is** to solve the problems that come up in our daily work, not avoid them altogether.

As an individual – know that as company priorities shift and as the organization grows, your role and place on the field will change with it. You should be open to your role looking different over time. We'll each do our best to help one another through those changes.

## Improve continuously

Help to make things better – for each other, for our company, and for our team. We're not afraid of offering each other feedback to improve things; we're afraid of regressing from not wanting to speak out.

In the words of Seth Godin, _**"Make things better by making better things."**_

As an example, each person who goes through onboarding makes the process better for the next person by offering feedback and insight about ways in which we can improve the process.

## Make yourself obsolete

Everyone's goal is to make themselves obsolete – build a tower, hand it off, and make it better.

Have someone else step in and take over an area, function, role or set of responsibilities so that you can move on and build new things at the company. It's good for them and good for you.

Making yourself obsolete and letting go of responsibilities can be difficult – but we reward and encourage this behavior, we don't punish it.

## Know the tools

We work efficiently by being expert users of our tools – whether computer, software, or workflows. Being efficient and effective helps you maintain flow and focus and get more done.

"_Know the tools. This is not an end in itself, but a way to maintain "flow" while [doing your job]. Every time you have to think about how to make your [email app or text editor or version-control system] do what you want, it bumps you out of your higher-level thought process. These "micro-interruptions" are small, but they add up quickly. **People who learn their tools, practice using their tools, and automate things that the tools can't do by themselves can easily be several times as productive as those who do none of those things.**"_
