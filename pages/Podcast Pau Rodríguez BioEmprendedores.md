Notes about the podcast in BioEmprendedores to [Pau Rodríguez](../_people/Pau%20Rodríguez.md) of [Methinks](Methinks.md). 

# Podcast bio

## Strong points of Methinks value proposition
- Stroke is the second most common death cause in the world.  
- Today you need contrast CT to see the thrombus.  With their model, they can predict if there is a thrombus with regular CT.  
- Application to all the hospitals in the world, specially the regional hospitals that do not have a specialist to perform a CT with contrast. 
- Strong team: having the capability to incorporate advisors and investors that are very relevant in their field. 
- Having Cristian is very important, as he can reduce risks for investors because of his early exits with other companies. 
- Purpose and values of the team: Pau reinforces a lot of this idea during the interview.  

## Weak points of Methinks
* Fierce competition: big players working there. They are fighting to be the standard protocols and change the clinical guidelines. 
*  A lot of the big players are already in the hospital and have also a lot of data. Why don't they develop something similar? 
	* ==What are the chances that they discovered something that cannot be copied by others? ==

## Roadmap Methinks 
- Market entry in 2023 (apparently in both Europe and CE)
- The most essential idea is to demonstrate the clinical validation of their technology. 
- They are working in several products at the same time. 
- Current round of 4 millions (2.5M, not diluting from the EIC accelerator).
- Using convertible notes. 
- Series A in 2024-2025 (8 millions) for expanding. 
- Right now, they are 10 people, looking for another 10 during the next year to expand (50% developers, 50% clinical, regulatory, etc...)

## Personal statement Pau Rodríguez. 
* Using his story as an entrepreneur: rugby player, entrepreneur in residence at Nina Capital. 
* Values and principles applied to the team. 
* Guide to hiring:
	* values and what you can do for us. 


## Business development 
* For Methinks, there is no pressure to understand how to sell their solution. It's far more important to develop a solution that can be the standard protocol in stroke. 
* Developing various tools and applications to deal with stroke: adding value to each of the stakeholders in the disease. 

## Ideas from the podcast 
- how ambitious they are showing what their value proposition can do in different tasks related with stroke. They are not shy showing the potential of what they can do. 
	- How important is here the track record of the founders? 

## What makes different tensor in comparison with Methinks.  
### What are being doing differently? 
* Culture: asynchronous culture and automation. 
* Approach to tech development: 
	* DevOps and scalable development mindset: look at the way we are applying regulatory and the technical file is very interesting. 
* How different research is at Tensor? 
	* Image synthesis is the key to many problems. 
	* Albert Clèrigues: brain atrophy methods. 
	* University of Girona?
* The role of Roger in the company.  

### What are we doing faster?
* Clinical validation looks faster than theirs. Our problem statement is easier than theirs. 
* Regulatory looks faster. (==probably overoptimistic==) 
* Path to sales (==probably overoptimistic==)

### What are we doing it worst? 
* Investing
* Contacts with international centers, especially in the United States. 

### What should we be doing more? 
* Build the rationale and the story telling that helps us to communicate better our mission in the long term: ==helping clinicians to predict earlier the treatment failure and improve decision-making==. 
* Clinical integration: having data to validate and to implement new ideas in the future: having new stakeholders. 
* Resilience and adaptability: invest in acquiring problem-solving intelligence as a team: see the example of [Basecamp](Basecamp.md), and how they compete with much bigger teams. 
* More innovation and tools to learn to decide in which things to work on.

# Personal learning 
- Being disciplined to track progress in all directions. 
- Talks with founders.  You learn a lot from this feedback.
