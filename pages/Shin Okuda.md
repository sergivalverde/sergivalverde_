Shin Okuda is the founder of Waka Waka.  

Some interesting quotes:

From [Mouth Wash](https://mouthwash.co/journal/sitting-down-with-shin-and-kristin-okuda)

> I can’t help but notice all the books that the two of them have collected over the years. I’m sure more are packed away as they get ready to move. Equally important to them making great work, is the ability to stay inspired and continue to learn new things.
