* It is very complex for founders to charge for their solution because they want to avoid feeling rejected. 
* What is the most efficient way to understand and to know what it is relevant for your customers?
*  Surveys vs real-world experience (talking to customers): 
	* The Airbnb example:
		* the user's example that tried by himself for a lot of time and offered them to share the experience. 
	* The TWITCH example:
		* They were building all the potential features in the Twitch platform, but what people asked for was to stream for higher resolution. 
		* This was an easy implementation to do instead of all the bell and wishes planned. 
		* Now it's obvious to see it, but it was very complicated to see it at the moment it was happening. 
* Putting yourself in a situation where you can have a deep conversation helps. 

> A potential customer's opinion is not valuable unless they want to pay you, use it regularly or share it with their friends. 

* Different ways to capital:
	* Financial capital: the pay you
	*  Capital: usage
	* Social Capital: give it to their friends. 

* [[Rejection]] is difficult to overcome because you would like to avoid being attached. 
	* Ego protection.
	* If I know that I'm wrong, my ego suffers, my cofounders, etc... 
	* The STRIPE example:
		* they implemented a hypothesis and they charged more than the competition. It's a logical test but for a founder is a crippling decision
		* What is the most easy and fast test that we can implement to know if people want our product? 

* What if happens when they reject you?
	* Sometimes founders cannot see it. 
	* You need to be dispassionate and move on about the next thing. 
	* The founders trap:
		* Sales is not like what lawyers have to do to convince a jury: the jury has to decide and they try to convince them to choose theirs. 
		* The best sales people do not need to convince, instead what they do is learning and filtering. It's a succesful conversation with the customer and if the customer says no quickly:
			* learning: the customer teaches about the other kinds of customers that will also say no.
			* filtering out customers that will also say no **it's a success!
		* That NO is a gift to understand better the market. 
		* ==Figure out what you could have asked them so they would have said no during the first 5 minutes==
		* Customer validation at YC
			* Every sales call should start with three questions that permit to disqualify themselves from your product. 

* Repeated themes in founders:
	* being willing to receive a no.
	* being willing to test the core hypothesis.
	* Not feeling bad when somebody rejects you.
